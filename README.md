### Author Note
This project was my plan to leave something good for the community. However, due to my busy schedule with work and school, It has not progressed much. If anyone want to contribute to the project, please email me. I would be glad to share you my plan with the platform.

Overall, the concept is -> you come to platform, capture a image of whatever ingredient you have -> model detect the ingredient and feed fine tuned models with the model -> returns list of available recipes -> user prepare it thus preparing sth delicious without wasting food.

Is that all, No. If I was a user and I land to some page like this, I would like to know I can trust it. It should be convincing and intimidating. What if when u land in the page, u see post of people who actually shared the recipe made my ingredient they thought would end up in trashcan. Thus, I want to have this as a feed where a community can be built up, vidoes, pictures or text could be shared. 

Is that all. What about the future? what is the thing u want to do that most of existing apps does not. Sure, there are lot of apps that actually does it with freemium or premium ideology. People can use that for sure. But I bet none of these apps have the goal of preventing food waste. The plan of our community platform is not to just help you prepare at home but more or less allowing u to give something to community. I had another project I went to pitch to the business school called Leftover to Livelihood, meaning you made something in large amount or something ur family is already tired off. Or something u literally made by using our site but now u want to give it back to community. Or you are restaurant owners or staffs who is tired off throwing good foods into the trashcans. For me the idea was great, but of course nobody invest cause nobody would invest in sth that has nothing in return. But when I get a chance building this I would for surely integrate here.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
